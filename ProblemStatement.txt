DEVELOP A JAVA APPLICATION TO PERFORM THE BELOW-MENTIONED TASK BY FOLLOWING THE BELOW-MENTIONED GUIDELINES.

TASK:
Perform an operation to generate the FACTORIAL of a particular number.

GUIDELINES:
1. Define a package named com.qualizeal.javaapp08.operation in the application.
2. Define a class named FactorialNumber in the above-mentioned package.
3. Define a method named defineFactorialNumber and return the definition of a Factorial number as a text.
4. Define a method named generateFactorialNumber in the above-mentioned class for performing the task.
5. The above-mentioned method:
	a) must be accessible to any class from any package.
	b) must contain one parameter of number type with a range from 0 to 2,147,483,647.
	c) must perform the task and return the result as a number with a range from 0 to 2,147,483,647.
	d) must perform the task without using recursion.
	e) must return -1 if the value passed as a parameter is a negative number.
	f) must return -2 if the value passed as a parameter is 0.
	
IMPORTANT NOTE:
1. Use the program class named App available in the application to execute your code.
2. Sample inputs with expected outputs are given below for your reference which you can use to validate your logic in the code. 
3. Once finished with the tasks, run the unit tests to verify if you have completed the tasks successfully as well as followed the guidelines.
4. You can use print statements for your reference while writing the code but do remember to remove them before submitting the code.
5. Only the task and implementation of guidelines are considered for evaluation and not the code in the program class.
6. Once finished with the application development, push the code back to the remote repository from where you have cloned the application.
7. Do remember to push your code to the branch with your name and not the main branch.
